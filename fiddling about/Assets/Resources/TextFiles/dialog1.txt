[Claire]: Do you have a name?
[No]: No.
[Claire]: You don't have a name?

[No]: Got it in one, friendo!

[Claire]: You could die, you know.
[No]: Death's a bit different for androids and gynoids like me. Worst case, you have to throw me back into one of these vats and let me restore my memories from a backup.
[No]: Speaking of; I don't want to forget you. Let me make a backup right now.
